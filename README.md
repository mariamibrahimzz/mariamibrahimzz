# 💡Mariam Ibrahim | AI & ML Enthusiast | Embedded Systems Explorer

Hey there! I'm Mariam Ibrahim, a passionate Electronics & Communication Engineering student with a sharp edge in **Artificial Intelligence** and **Machine Learning**. When I’m not wiring circuits or diving into embedded systems, I’m training models, building smart solutions, and solving real-world problems with data.

## 🔬 Current Focus
I’m currently leveling up my AI/ML skillset with a hands-on, project-based approach. I love experimenting with models, working with real datasets, and creating tools that make an impact — especially at the intersection of **embedded systems and intelligence**.


## 🧰 Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python, C/C++, MATLAB
- **ML/DL:** scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, pandas, OpenCV,PyTorch
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Git, Arduino IDE, VS Code
- **Other Interests:** Signal processing, computer vision, edge AI

## 🎯 Goals
- Push more AI projects to production
- Explore the overlap between embedded systems & AI (TinyML!)
- Collaborate with innovators and contribute to open-source

## 📫 Let’s Connect!
Got feedback, ideas, or collaboration proposals? I’d love to hear from you.
